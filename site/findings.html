	    				The United States age distribution trend presents a similar percentage of population between ages 0-50 and then starts decaying; faster for ages 70+. This trend is similar in states like Georgia, California, Illinois and others. Nevertheless, some states like Maine, New Hampshire or Vermont have different distributions where one age range between 40-50s is predominant, and younger and older populations are much smaller. District of Columbia has a similar behavior but its predominant age is between 20-30s. However, these latest populations are much smaller than bigger areas like California, Illinois or Georgia.

	    			<p>
	    				Utah has an interesting distribution where there are more younger people being the kids predominant. From there, the percentages decay in a smoother way.

	    			<h2>Aging</h2>
	    			<p>Japan and Germany are the two populations of the dataset with more aging people. At 2014, about 1/3 of Japan's population (~40M) was over 60 years old. Several <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/09/21/national/social-issues/japan-increasingly-gray-people-80-older-top-10-million" target="_blank">news articles</a> discuss this topic. Regarding Germany, about 27% of its population (~21.5M) is over 60.

	    			<p>
	    				However, Peru and Mexico have a bigger population of young people which could be caused by several reasons. One of them is the lack of sexual education among younger people that leads to a failure in birth control methods. Moreover, Peru and Mexico besides being latino countries, are places were the Catholic Church still have a big influence on decisions like sexual education on schools, use of birth control methods, abortion, and so on.
